# Coloring molecules for Caco-2 cell permeability

By combining a Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) and a Forward fully connected Neural Network (FNN) with an integrated gradients explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, the authors developed MolGrad and tested it on a number of ADME predictive tasks. MolGrad incorporates explainable features to facilitate interpretation of the predictions.Â  This model has been trained using experimental data on the permeability of molecules across Caco2 cell membranes (Papp, cm s-1)
